## üÜï ASR Modes

### ‚òÅÔ∏è Cloud ASR (Default)

- **Benefits**: Superior accuracy, better handling of music terminology, faster processing
- **Privacy**: Audio processed securely, not stored
- **Fallback**: Automatically switches to Browser ASR if unavailable

- **Usage**: Perfect for sensitive information or offline scenarios

## üí° Example Transformation

**What you say:**
"Um, so today we worked on, uh, the Bach invention and she's, you know, getting better with the fingering but, uh, she needs to practice the left hand more slowly."

**What you get:**

### Best Practices
- **Speak clearly** but naturally - don't overthink it
- **Include key details**: What you worked on, progress made, areas for improvement
- **Mention practice goals**: What the student should focus on before the next lesson
- **Be specific**: Instead of "good progress," say "mastered the first 8 bars"

## üîí Privacy & Security

- **ASR Mode Choice**: Select between cloud processing or local-only processing
- **Secure Relay**: Cloud ASR uses secure relay server - API keys never in extension
- **No Data Storage**: Neither mode stores your recordings permanently
